# Simulation-Science

Hello, 

This is my channel with educational films and explanatory videos about simulation and machine learning. My topics include  Continuum Mechanics, Finite elemeent method, 
Finite difference method, Finite volume method, Structural mechanics, Isogeometric analysis, structural dynamics, Molecular dynamics simulations and many more in context
of civil, mechanical and aerospace application domains. There are practical coding segments in Python, Julia, LAMMPS, or Matlab in a lot of videos. These films and videos also 
demonstrate how the themes are applied in contemporary libraries such as TensorFlow,Probability, JAX, NumPy, SciPy, SciML and many others.

All material is also available on the GitHub Repo of the channel: https://github.com/ArmaanSingh007/Simulation-Science.git

Enjoy!  Kindly provide some feedback as well.
